## Challenge Description
Write a function to accepts an integer, and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

## Approach & Efficiency
Use 3 variables.Two of them to store 0 and 1 and one variable as temporary to hold the final output.Then write a function that takes in a number and we iterate through a while loop to get the sum of the nth number and store it in the temporary variable.
